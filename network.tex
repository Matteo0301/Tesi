\chapter{Wi-Fi access}
In the thesis on which \cite{previouswork} this work is based it was suggested
to use the Fern wifi cracker \cite{fern} to gain access to the target newtwork.
Tis tool is basically a GUI for the aircrack-ng suite \cite{aircrack} and
exposes all the features of the command line tool. It can in fact perform
a lot of other attacks, aside from the WPA/WPA2 cracking, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic attacks on the access point
    \item MITM attacks
    \item Bruteforce attacks using protocols such as FTP, HTTP/HTTPS and TELNET
    \item Deauthentication, access point spoofing and replay attacks
\end{itemize}

Nevertheless, as the goal of this work is to automate the process, the command
line tool may prove to be more useful, as it can be easily integrated in a
script.\\

Other tools that can be employed instead of aircrack-ng are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reaver \cite{reaver}: a tool that exploits a flaw in the WPS
        implementation of some routers using the WPS Pixie-Dust and other brute-force attacks
    \item Wifite \cite{wifite}: a python script that is a frontend for a lot of 
        tools, including aircrack-ng, reaver, cowpatty, pyrit, tshark, etc. It
        is therefore perfect to automate the process of vulnerability assessment
        of a wifi network
    \item Bully \cite{bully}: similar to Reaver
\end{itemize}

The suggested tool is Wifite, as it is the most complete and it is a frontend
to all other tools presented here.\\
