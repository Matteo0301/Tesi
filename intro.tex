\chapter{Introduction}
In this part of the dissertation we will discuss the improvements over
previous work \cite{previouswork}, both in terms of alternative tools
with respect to the ones presented in that thesis, and in terms of additional
areas where we can search for vulnerabilities.\\\\
In particular we will discuss how to gain access to the target network and list the
various programs that already exist for this purpose. We will also discuss
an extension to the previous work that allows to retrieve the memory image
of the target device and analyze it offline, aiming to find useful information
about what processes were running on said device and inspecting their memory.\\\\
Finally we will discuss what scripts were developed to automate the process
and how to use them in practice, but leaving the actual testing to the second part
of the thesis, and focusing only on their options and requirements.
