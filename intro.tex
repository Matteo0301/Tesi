\chapter{Introduction}
In this part of the dissertation we will discuss the improvements over
previous works \cite{previouswork}, both in terms of alternative tools
with respect to the ones presented in that thesis, and in terms of additional
areas where we can search for vulnerabilities.\\
In particular we will discuss the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaining Wi-Fi access to the target network and exploring its weak points
    \item Attacks to the target network from the inside
    \item Attacks to the exported services of the target device, in particular web services
    \item An extension to the previous work, which allows to retrieve the memory
        image of the target device and analyze it offline
\end{itemize}
