I would like to thank my parents and my sister for supporting me during these years,
and all my family for always being there for me.\\
I would also like to thank my friends Michele, Pietro and Elisabetta for
sharing with me this experience and for all the time we spent together. I hope
we will continue to support each other in the future, particularly
for the rest of our years here at the university.\\
Last but not least, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Bruno Crispo,
for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and for his precious
advice and support.
