\chapter{Conclusions}
The goal of this project was to develop a set of scripts to automate the process
of vulnerability assessment of IoT devices and it has been, for the part concerning
the network, achieved. The scripts developed can be used to scan the network, either
to to discover all hosts or only the ones that have been newly connected, and
they can also be used to scan the hosts for open ports and vulnerabilities.\\
Moreover we can use the packet sniffer script to capture the communication between
two hosts and analyze it to find vulnerabilities, using standard tools such as Wireshark.\\
We also found some tools that can be used as alternatives to the ones we used,
and we presented a way to retrieve and analyze the memory of IoT devices.\\
Unfortunately we were not able to find a way to analyze the firmware or memory of the device,
so we had to stop the analysis at the network level, but the main goals of the
project have been achieved, so others can use the same tools to continue the analysis,
also  on other devices.
