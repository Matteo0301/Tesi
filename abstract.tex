In the last few years, the security of IoT devices has become a major concern
in the field of Computer Science. In fact we are surrounded by always
new devices, such as cameras, smart speakers, and domotic devices in general,
that have become an integral part of our lives. \\
This means we are more and more exposed to attack that can compromise our
privacy and security. \\
The focus of this thesis is to automate the process of finding vulnerabilities
in such devices, by the means of finding the right tools and scripting the
various phases of the process. \\\\
This work will divided into two parts: a first more theoretical part, where
we will analyze the proposed tools and compare them to the used in previous works.
We will also analyze the scripts created to help the automation and explain their capabilities. \\
In a second, more practical part, we will test these tools on a real device,
focusing on the actions that have been successfully automated, and hence require
little to no user interaction. \\
